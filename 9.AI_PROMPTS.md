# Appendix - AI Tool Use and Boundaries

This appendix documents where AI assistance was used and where it was not used.

## Non-Negotiable Boundary

AI assistance was used for engineering support, drafting, and troubleshooting. Research decisions, experiment design, metric interpretation, and final claims were made by the author.

## Acceptable Use in This Project

- environment setup troubleshooting
- boilerplate scaffolding (scripts/notebook glue)
- code refactoring suggestions
- markdown restructuring for clarity
- debugging hypotheses to verify manually

## Not Delegated to AI

- final research questions
- model comparison design
- metric selection and interpretation
- statistical claim decisions
- dissertation conclusions

## Validation Process for AI-Suggested Changes

For any AI-proposed code or text:
1. Check against repository code and official docs.
2. Run locally/Colab and inspect outputs.
3. Keep only changes that improve reproducibility, clarity, or correctness.
4. Record substantive changes in the logbook and result artifacts.

## Examples of AI Assistance

- Drafting helper scripts for JSON analysis and plotting.
- Suggesting safer SQL cleaning/validation structure.
- Reformatting dense markdown into examiner-readable sections.

## Why This Is Defensible

The project keeps auditable artifacts (code diffs, run JSONs, metrics tables, and logs). This makes authorship and decision flow inspectable even when AI tooling is used for support tasks.
