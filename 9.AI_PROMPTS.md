# AI Assistance Disclosure

## Where AI was used

| Location | AI support used |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/generate_research_comparison.py` | Reporting boilerplate (run discovery, CSV wiring, repeated metric/plot code) |
| `nl2sql/react_pipeline.py` | Repetitive control-flow scaffolding (repair branches, stop/trace fields) |
| `nl2sql/validation.py` | Validation boilerplate and regex cleanup |
| `notebooks/02_baseline_prompting_eval.ipynb` | Experiment-grid scaffolding (K/seed loops, metadata, output path handling) |
| `notebooks/03_agentic_eval.ipynb` | Repeated notebook scaffolding (config blocks, run loops, summary cells) |
| `notebooks/05_qlora_train_eval.ipynb` | Training/eval scaffolding (adapter path handling, grid loops, output exports) |
| `LOGBOOK.md`, `10_EXPERIMENT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`, `11_REPLICATION_POSITIONING.md`, `EXAMINER_QA.md` | Editing for structure, clarity, and concise wording |

## Scope note

AI was used for repetitive implementation and editing tasks. Research design, interpretation, and final claims were author decisions.
