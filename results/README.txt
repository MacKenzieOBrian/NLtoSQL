results layout (current)

active folders used by notebooks/scripts:
- results/baseline/runs
- results/baseline/model_family
- results/qlora/runs
- results/qlora/model_family
- results/analysis/primary
- results/analysis/extension_constrained

archived folders moved out of active run discovery:
- results/archive/legacy/baseline_runs
- results/archive/legacy/qlora_runs
- results/archive/legacy/analysis
- results/archive/legacy/runs_snapshots

notes:
- active folders keep current dissertation-focused artifacts.
- legacy folders keep older, duplicate, or historical artifacts for traceability.
- scripts that scan results/baseline/runs and results/qlora/runs now see a cleaner set.
