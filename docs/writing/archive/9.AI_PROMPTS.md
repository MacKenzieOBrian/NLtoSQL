# AI Assistance Disclosure

## simple boundary
AI helped with coding boilerplate and cleanup tasks.
I made the research choices, run choices, and final conclusions.

## file-by-file summary

`/Users/mackenzieobrian/MacDoc/Dissertation/scripts/generate_research_comparison.py`
ai helped with: cli scaffold, file discovery, json loading, row joins, csv writing.
i decided: which run comparisons to test, which metrics matter, and how to interpret the stats.

`/Users/mackenzieobrian/MacDoc/Dissertation/scripts/colab_setup.sh`
ai helped with: setup script structure and install command boilerplate.
i decided: package versions and whether the runtime setup is accepted.

`/Users/mackenzieobrian/MacDoc/Dissertation/nl2sql/experiment_helpers.py`
ai helped with: helper function structure for naming and option handling.
i decided: allowed experiment options and how they are used in runs.

`/Users/mackenzieobrian/MacDoc/Dissertation/notebooks/02_baseline_prompting_eval.ipynb`
ai helped with: repeated loop code and output-save scaffolding.
i decided: seeds, k-values, run plans, and ablation settings.

`/Users/mackenzieobrian/MacDoc/Dissertation/notebooks/03_agentic_eval.ipynb` (historical)
ai helped with: repeated evaluation cell structure and summary wiring.
i decided: react settings and interpretation when this extension path was used.

`/Users/mackenzieobrian/MacDoc/Dissertation/notebooks/05_qlora_train_eval.ipynb`
ai helped with: training/eval loop scaffolding and output wiring.
i decided: model presets, adapter workflow, and run priorities.

`/Users/mackenzieobrian/MacDoc/Dissertation/nl2sql/validation.py`
ai helped with: wrapper boilerplate.
i decided: the real validation policy in core code.

`/Users/mackenzieobrian/MacDoc/Dissertation/nl2sql/*.py` (compatibility wrappers)
ai helped with: simple import re-export wrappers to keep old paths working.
i decided: package layout and compatibility strategy.

## concrete non-important code examples
`generate_research_comparison.py`: `parse_args`, `main`, `_discover_run_jsons`, `_build_per_item_from_run_jsons`, `_join_for_pair`, `_prepare_per_item`.
`colab_setup.sh`: uninstall block, grouped pip install blocks, final echo line.
`experiment_helpers.py`: alias formatting and option map helpers.
`02_baseline_prompting_eval.ipynb`: run loop cell and run-plan switch cell.
`05_qlora_train_eval.ipynb`: qlora run loop cell and run-plan switch cell.
`nl2sql/*.py` wrappers: one-line `from ... import *` re-export files.

## not AI-owned decisions
research question, hypothesis, final experiment scope, acceptance criteria, and dissertation claims were my decisions.
