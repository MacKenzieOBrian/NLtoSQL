# Logbook (Dissertation Notes)

## Project aim
Evaluate open-source NL->SQL improvements under constrained hardware with controlled comparisons.

## Timeline highlights
- 2025-09 to 2025-10: scope and evaluation framing established (EX/TS-first).
- 2025-11 to 2025-12: baseline execution pipeline and prompting runs completed.
- 2026-01: QLoRA training/eval pipeline completed.
- 2026-01 to 2026-02: ReAct infrastructure refined for bounded repair and traceability.
- 2026-02: ReAct loop updated to model-driven Thought/Action/Observation (closer to reference behavior than fixed-order controller flow).

## Current evidence position
- Primary claims: base vs qlora, controlled by k/seed.
- Secondary claims: ReAct infrastructure behavior.
- Residual errors: join path, aggregation, value linking.

## Writing rule per claim
1. State setup.
2. Report EX/TS result and uncertainty.
3. Add paired significance.
4. Explain with failure taxonomy.
